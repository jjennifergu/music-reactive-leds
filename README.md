The music reactive LED strip lights up with different colors and patterns when the microphone picks up music. This project uses an Arduino Uno board as the base, the ArduinoFHT library to decode the sound into octaves (which is then converted to RGB values), the FastLED library to drive the LED strip, and an HC-05 Bluetooth module to receive commands from mobile devices.

Other Information:
This project was done in Summer 2019 at the BlueStamp Engineering Program. The project introduced me to software, electrical, and mechanical engineering and helped me become proficient in C++ and Arduino programming, circuit design and construction, and soldering.
